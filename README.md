A website designed using **React**, specifically for Drexel University students who have lost their co-ops because of COVID-19 situation.

The main purpose is to connect the students looking for a summer internship with companies and start-ups in Greater Philadelphia Area and other parts of the country.  

## Setting up the environment:

Create the Root Folder:

```bash
mkdir reactApp
cd reactApp
```

```bash
npm install react --save
```
Install the *react-dom* package:
```bash
npm install react-dom --save
```
Install *create-react-app*:
```bash
npm install create-react-app
```
Create your app:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
Run the server to run the webpage on local host:
```bash
npm start
```
To use the header typing animation (follow the documentation at: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typist]):
