A website designed using **React**, specifically for Drexel University students who have lost their co-ops because of COVID-19 situation.

The main purpose is to connect the students looking for a summer internship with companies and start-ups in Greater Philadelphia Area and other parts of the country.  

## Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies by using the following command from the cloned directory:

```bash
npm install
```
To run the website locally:
```bash
npm start
```
To use the header typing animation (follow the documentation at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typist):
```bash
npm install react-typist
```
### Feel free to fork the project and build a version for your own university or college
